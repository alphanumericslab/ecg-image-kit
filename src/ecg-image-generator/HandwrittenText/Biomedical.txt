An electrocardiogram records the electrical signals in your heart. It's a common and painless test used to quickly detect heart problems and monitor your heart's health.

Electrocardiograms — also called ECGs or EKGs — are often done in a doctor's office, a clinic or a hospital room. ECG machines are standard equipment in operating rooms and ambulances. Some personal devices, such as smart watches, offer ECG monitoring. Ask your doctor if this is an option for you.

Why it's done
An electrocardiogram is a painless, noninvasive way to help diagnose many common heart problems in people of all ages. Your doctor may use an electrocardiogram to determine or detect:

Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias)
If blocked or narrowed arteries in your heart (coronary artery disease) are causing chest pain or a heart attack
Whether you have had a previous heart attack
How well certain heart disease treatments, such as a pacemaker, are working
You may need an ECG if you have any of the following signs and symptoms:

Chest pain
Dizziness, lightheadedness or confusion
Heart palpitations
Rapid pulse
Shortness of breath
Weakness, fatigue or a decline in ability to exercise
The American Heart Association doesn't recommend using electrocardiograms to assess adults at low risk who don't have symptoms. But if you have a family history of heart disease, your doctor may suggest an electrocardiogram as a screening test, even if you have no symptoms.

If your symptoms tend to come and go, they may not be captured during a standard ECG recording. In this case your doctor may recommend remote or continuous ECG monitoring. There are several different types.

Holter monitor. A Holter monitor is a small, wearable device that records a continuous ECG, usually for 24 to 48 hours.
Event monitor. This portable device is similar to a Holter monitor, but it records only at certain times for a few minutes at a time. You can wear it longer than a Holter monitor, typically 30 days. You generally push a button when you feel symptoms. Some devices automatically record when an abnormal rhythm is detected.
