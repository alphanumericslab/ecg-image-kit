# Finetuning YOLOv7 for ECG lead detection

## Introduction
Multilead ECG images provide a multi-perspective view of the heart's electrical activity by displaying ECG segments from different leads simultaneously. Each lead captures electrical signals from distinct angles and planes of the heart, offering a unique view of its function. By comparing the segments from multiple leads, clinicians can more accurately diagnose various cardiac conditions, such as ischemia, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarctions. This multidimensional approach enhances the ability to detect subtle abnormalities that might be missed when using a single lead, ultimately improving patient outcomes through more precise and detailed cardiac assessments.

Detecting the boundary boxes around the different leads in ECG images is required for extracting the ECG time series of each lead. This is a nontrivial task in real ECG images. Adjacent leads can run into each other due to measurement noises, baseline wander and ECG amplitudes. They are also impacted by the angle of view and perspective of scanned ECG images or pictures. The problem can be studied from an image segmentation or region of interest (ROI) detection perspective. We provide a solution for this problem using the YOLO model.

YOLO stands for "You Only Look Once"; it is a popular family of real-time object detection algorithms. The original YOLO object detector was first released in 2016. Our ROI detection codebase is built upon [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7). The official YOLOv7 paper, titled "YOLOv7: Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors," was released in July 2022 by [Chien-Yao Wang, Alexey Bochkovskiy, and Hong-Yuan Mark Liao](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.02696).

## Installation
- Setup with Conda env: 
     ```
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate ROI
     ```

- Set up with pip:
        
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Training the model
In this repo, we use YOLOv7 to detect different leads in the ECG image. The codebase has been modified specifically for ECG images. 

### Custom Data
- To tune the YOLOv7 model (or its more recent updates) with this codebase, make sure your custom data is arranged as follows:

        - data
            - train
                - images
                    - 1.png
                    - 2.png
                    - 3.png
                - labels
                    - 1.txt
                    - 2.txt
                    - 3.txt
    
    The labels should be in a text file, with every line corresponding to a different bounding box. The first value should be the label of the object in the box. The next four values should correspond to the bounding box attributes, in the format xywh [center of the bouding box in x coordinate, center of the bouding box in y coordinate, width of the box, height of the box]. All the box attributes should be normalized with respect to the box dimensions.

    *Note:* The label list should be decided by the user.

    Example images:

     | ![Sythentic ECG image](Data/train_imgs/AcumeMI-ECG1.png) | ![GT Image](Data/GT/AcumeMI-ECG1.png) |

     | ECG Image                           | Ground truth ECG image                            |
     | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
     | ![Sythentic ECG image](Data/train_imgs/AcumeMI-ECG4.png) | ![GT Image](Data/GT/AcumeMI-ECG4.png) |
